Joomla! Tiny But Strong Library for exporting OpenDocuments and Excel files.

You can zip and install it in your joomla. It will go to your /libraries/ joomla folder.

I'm using it to export excel and opendocument files of my components. Find all the info at http://www.tinybutstrong.com/

Thanks to skrol29dev for creating this amazing library.
